# CDKTN Go bindings for hashicorp/time provider version 0.13.1

This repo builds and publishes the [Terraform time provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/time/0.13.1/docs) bindings for [CDK Terrain](https://cdktn.io).

## Go Package

The go package is generated into the [`github.com/cdktn-io/cdktn-provider-time-go`](https://github.com/cdktn-io/cdktn-provider-time-go) package.

`go get github.com/cdktn-io/cdktn-provider-time-go/time/<version>`

Where `<version>` is the version of the prebuilt provider you would like to use e.g. `v11`. The full module name can be found
within the [go.mod](https://github.com/cdktn-io/cdktn-provider-time-go/blob/main/time/go.mod#L1) file.

## Docs

Find auto-generated docs for this provider [here](https://github.com/cdktn-io/cdktn-provider-time/blob/main/docs/API.go.md).


## Versioning

This project is explicitly not tracking the Terraform time provider version 1:1. In fact, it always tracks `latest` of `~> 0.7` with every release. If there are scenarios where you explicitly have to pin your provider version, you can do so by [generating the provider constructs manually](https://cdktn.io/docs/concepts/providers#import-providers).

These are the upstream dependencies:

* [CDK Terrain](https://cdktn.io) - Last official release
* [Terraform time provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/time/0.13.1)
* [Terraform Engine](https://terraform.io)

If there are breaking changes (backward incompatible) in any of the above, the major version of this project will be bumped.
